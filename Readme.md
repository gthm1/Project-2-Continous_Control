## Project 2: Continuous Control


#### Overview of the project
> In this project our goal is to train a agent i.e double jointed arm to move to target location. 

> A reward of 0.1 is provided for every time step the arm is in the target location thus enabling the agent to maintain its position at the target location. 

> We have 33 possible states corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm and action space is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

#### Requirement Gathering And Running Project

> To run this project on your local machine you should have certain packages on your system. You can find them in requirements.txt. They can be installed using the command "pip install requirements.txt".

> You can download the required environment using the links below:

> Windows_64bit : https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip 

> linux : https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip 

> Mac : https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip

> Then run the cells in Continuous_Control.ipynb, then you will be able to train the agent which can solve the task
